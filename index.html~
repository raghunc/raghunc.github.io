  <p>    Hello! Welcome to my personal website (and my blog). I am interested in Physics, (scientific) computing and a little electronics. I have a Bachelor's and a Master's, both in Electrical Engineering.</p>
<p>This blog is mostly to note some interesting stuff I come across, and to record my ideas and opinions (not always technical stuff).</p>
