title: My Projects
---

Here I list my work in different areas: quantum computing, condensed matter physics (some simulations of simple models), and machine learning/programming stuff.

As of Nov. 2016, I have finished transcirption part of my work on quantum walks.

- [First webpage](/work/quantumwalk_intro.html) is an introduction to (dicrete) quantum walk, and contrasts it with the classical random walk.  
- [Next webpage](/work/quantumwalk_noisy.html) extends on the introductory page on quantum walk, and introduces a model of noise in the quantum walk, and contrasts the results with ideal quantum walk.  
- [This page](/work/kraus1.html) is an attempt to cast the problem of noisy quantum walk in quantum operator language (work in progress).  

All the numerical results and plots displayed were obtained using the [Julia](https://julialang.org). Julia is open source, quite fast compared to MATLAB, and numerical libraries such as BLAS are natively called (no need to install extra packages for numerical computing, unlike Python). Julia has multiple libraries for plotting, and I have used (my favorite) [Gadfly](http://gadflyjl.org/), which is inspired by "ggplot2" for R, and "The Grammar of Graphics" by Leland Wilkinson.

Please let me know if you find any inaccuracies in the results or the methods used. The pages in work have two deficiencies, due to conevrsion from LaTeX to markdown/HTML:

- Equation references.    
- Citations: Citing papers which are the source for my ideas/results.  

I promise to fix these things as early as I can.
