Welcome to my homepage!
-----

Welcome to my (digital) home. I am Raghu Nandan Chilukuri, and this is my corner in the interwebz where I occasionally plan to write about my work and interesting things I come across: spanning Quantum computing, Condensed matter physics and (scientific) computing.

You find more about me in the [About](about.html) section or find my contact in the [Contact](contact.html) section. Also, my CV can be accessed [here](files/RaghuChilukuri_C.pdf) (in pdf format).

About this site
--------
After many attempts at building a website and trying many ready-to-use template solutions, I was not satisfied with them. Accidentally, I have discovered a world of static site generators, and have tried quite a few based on Ruby (Jekyll), JavaScript (Metalsmith), Python (Pelican), and now, Haskell (Hakyll)!

I chose Hakyll for its myriad options (it uses [Pandoc](http://www.pandoc.org/) underneath), and also for its customizability which I hope helps me learn a Haskell for greater good :)
