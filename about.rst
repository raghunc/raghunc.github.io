I am Raghu Nandan Chilukuri. I am interested in (Condensed Matter) physics, scientific computing, and a little electronics. 


I hold a Master's degree from the University of Cincinnati (OH, USA) and a Bachelor's degree from Birla Institute of Technolology  and Science (BITS), both in Electrical Engineering.
