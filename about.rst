I am Raghu Nandan Chilukuri. I am interested in (Condensed Matter) physics, scientific computing, and a little electronics. 


I got my Bachelor's degree from Birla Institute of Technolology  and Science (BITS-Pilani, India) and my Master's degree from the University of Cincinnati (OH, USA), both in Electrical Engineering. My Master's thesis work focused on noisy `quantum walk`_, and numerical simulations of the noisy quantum walk.

I have worked in the industry in various positions in firmware/software, hardware verification, and in data science. In these positions, I have programmed extensively in C, Perl, Julia, and a good amount in Python, Tcl, FORTRAN and Verilog. Further information on my experience is here_.
