I have worked in different positions in industry. I have mentioned some highlights. This info can be found in my CV as well.

## Research

**Master's Thesis (University of Cincinnati)**  
Worked with Prof. Marc Cahay (Spintronics lab, University of Cincinnati) on numerical simulation of quantum random walks and modelling noisy quantum walks.

**Independent work**
Working on generalizing the noisy quantum walk and provide an alternative approach using the quantum-operations approach. Further details are [here](quantumwalk.html)

## Work Experience

**Intel Corporation**  
Front-End (FE) Verification: Support and methodology owner for VCS, Certitude (both Synopsys), and Intel specific internal tools. Scripting support for internal EDA tools of Intel.

**JustDial India Private Ltd.**  
 As a Data Scientist, I worked on implementing a recommender system for the e-commerce shopfront of JustDial. Implemented features using custom versions of clustering algorithms. Worked exclusively in the [Julia](http://julialang.org) Language.

### Internships

**Cambridge Silicon Radio(CSR) India Private Ltd.**  
- Characterizing physical parameters such as power, gain and stress-test of bluetooth chips, and testing the Bluetooth lower stack firmware.  
- Designed and implemented an audio test system to test different profiles for audio streaming and BLE (Bluetooth low energy) file transfer between
  multiple devices.

**Dept. of Electrical Engineering,IIT-Delhi**  
Change detection algorithms using segmentation and defocussing, using open-source computer vision libraries on a smart camera system.

**Infinera India Private Ltd.**  
 Worked on System-level Verification: Board simulation and system level testing of a system of line cards. Implemented a basic Verilog parser for netlist parsing and verification.


### Summer Internship

**Vikram Sarabhai Space Center (VSSC - Thiruvananthapuram, India)**  
 Interfacing and programming microcontrollers to generate waveforms for testing control electronics module of some electro-mechanical systems.
