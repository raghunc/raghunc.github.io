Welcome to my (digital) home. I am Raghu Nandan Chilukuri, and this is where I occasionally plan to write about my work and interesting things I come across: spanning Quantum computing, Condensed matter physics and (scientific) computing.

You find more about me, and my contact info in the "About_" page. Also, my CV can be accessed here_ (in pdf format).

.. rubric:: About this site
	    
After many attempts at building a website and trying many ready-to-use template solutions, I was not satisfied with them. Accidentally, I have discovered a world of static site generators, and have tried quite a few based on Ruby (Jekyll_), JavaScript (Metalsmith_), Python (Pelican_), and now Haskell (Hakyll_)!

I chose Hakyll for its flexibility (it uses Pandoc_ underneath), and its customizability which I hope helps me learn a little Haskell. Hopefully, I'll migrate all my earlier posts to this site soon.
