<p> Hello there, welcome to my website. After trying out too many web hosting services, like university offered pages, Google sites and Wordpress, I came across this beautiful way to host (mostly static) sites on github, powered by Jekyll. At the time of typing this, I am using my plain-vanilla text editor and creating pages with Jekyll. </p>

<p>I came across github pages on <a href="http://conceptviz.github.io"><b><i>this link</i></b></a>, which was posted on Twitter by <a href="http://michaelnielsen.org/"><b>Michael Nielsen</b></a>, and instantly fell in love with it. The link he posted has some excellent explanations and visualizations of topics in physics, programming etc., and subsequently, I discovered several such pages. Hence I created this page to record some interesting things I come across, and my learnings.</p>

<p>And unlike my other, attempts, I do hope to continue posting to this website.</p>
