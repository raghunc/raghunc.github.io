title: Static Site Generators
---
<p>I have already mentioned that github pages can host static webpages, and Jekyll was the first static site generator I encountered. Jekyll is powered by Ruby. And I started searching for similar static site generators powered in other languages, such as Python, JS, Clojure and others.</p>


<p>I came across several such (open-source) static site generators on the web, and a list is found <a href="https://www.staticgen.com">here</a>. I do hope to test out some of these new site generators. Although it is not possible to test each of the features, I do hope to test one site generator per each language (Python, Clojure, JS, Node.js etc).</p>
