<p>I had come across this course titled "<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/smac">Statistical Mechanics: Algorithms and Computations</a>" on Coursera. I can't say that I completed the course successfully, but I do plan to finish the content one day. The course, although supposedly self-contained, also has an optional companion <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Mechanics-Algorithms-Computations-Physics/dp/0198515367">textbook</a> which has some good reviews on Amazon. </p>

<p>This was not my first encounter with algorithms with origins Statistical Mechanics, thanks to the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. It is a member of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. The Metropolis-Hastings is named after Nicholas Metropolis and W.K.Hastings, but it does seem to have a controversial history (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis%E2%80%93Hastings_algorithm#History">Wiki link</a>) about its origins.
